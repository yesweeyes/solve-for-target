Retail Brand Brand Name Lighted Leather Cover Retail Brand Brand Name Lighted Leather Cover,1.0,3.0,1,0.0,"A Step Down In QualityI owned a brand name Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new brand name. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The brand name battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my brand name Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more",3.0,"['accessories', 'ereaders']"

Retail Brand Brand Name Lighted Leather Cover Brand Name Keyboard,1.0,4.0,1,1.0,"High Quality Case For Your brand nameI purchased this brand name case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the brand name. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the brand name perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the brand name itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the brand name. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the brand name itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this brand name case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Target!",4.0,"['accessories', 'ereaders']"
Retail Brand Brand Name Lighted Leather Cover,1.0,4.0,1,1.0,"Lightweight, good viewing area. 1,Finally received the brand name Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version brand name. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your brand name and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the brand name as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their brand name in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the brand name. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the brand name Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more",4.0,"['accessories', 'ereaders']"
Retail Brand Echo And Xyz Brand Tv Power Adapter,1.0,4.0,1,1.0,"Great first e-readerThis is the first e-reader I've gotten and I LOVE it! In general, brand names are awesome because there is a bunch of free material you can download on Target that you can just carry around with you. The page turning function is a little weird to get used to but you can also swipe if you don't like the sensors on the side. When you turn off the brand name there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad, which is kind of annoying, but it's not really worth it to pay to have the ads taken off. Again, just something to get used to. It's really easy to navigate, you can even highlight and take notes.

Brand New Electronics Brand Ipad16Gb 7 Ips Display Tablet Wifi 16 Gb Blue,1.0,5.0,6,1.0,"Works great with one critical flaw. (significantly improved)Having received my XYZ brand TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Target app and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the electronics brand TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Target app members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to app (Most Popular on app, For Kids on app) I want to be able to just see what's available for app or at least be able to see by category what's available for app. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Target wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with movie app, they'll understand that we pay for our app membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for app available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",30.0,['streaming media players']
