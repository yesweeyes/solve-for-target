I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The brand name keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new brand name in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the brand name as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new brand name-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old brand name keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new brand name very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the brand name. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the brand name's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the brand name's battery.Read more",9.0
5,Brand Name Keyboard Brand Name Keyboard,['electronics'],1.0,4.5,7,1.0,"Worth the money. Not perfect, but very very good for start to finish novels in good lightThe brand name is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The brand name is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the brand name store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The brand name store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more",31.5

(significantly improved)Having received my XYZ brand TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Target app and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the electronics brand TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Target app members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to app (Most Popular on app, For Kids on app) I want to be able to just see what's available for app or at least be able to see by category what's available for app. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Target wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with movie app, they'll understand that we pay for our app membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for app available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",30.0

I got an Echo Dot and liked it so much I then got the full size Echo. I originally go the Echo Dot for the novelty thinking I wouldn't really use it very much but it turns out that I use them all the time. It is not something that anyone really needs but it is handy and a lot of fun. Some of the things it does really well: It's great at voice recognition - you seldom have to repeat yourself. Setting timers, reminders, and alarms is as easy as saying Alexa, wake me at 7 am Or Alexa, tell me when 10 minutes is up. If you are a app member the Echo is great at playing music from your music library or from app music. It's also great at playing radio stations (using tune-in and other apps). In the morning I'll say Alexa, play 680 WRKO to listen to Kim and VB on the radio. Some of the things the Echo is bad at: It's well known that it uses computers brand's Bing search engine so most anything the Echo has to search for comes back with the response I don't know that. Being able to tell the Echo to use Yahoo or electonics brand would make this a five star rating. Also, if you set an alarm or reminder it only reminds you on the device you specify or the one that hears you. For example, if I'm in the upstairs bedroom (location of the Echo Dot) and say Remind me to call John Smith in 10 minutes and then I go downstairs to the kitchen (location of the Echo), the reminder will only be in the bedroom. It would be nice if I could have an alarm or reminder set on both devices. The Echo Dot has the same capability as the full size Echo as far as I can tell. The only difference is the full size Echo has much better sound for music. That being said, the Echo Dot still sounds great, amazing really, for such a small device. But the full size Echo is like listening to a stereo. Again, these are well-made devices and are a lot of fun and very useful. Maybe not a necessity but they sure are a fun conversation piece with guests or grandkids come around.",3697.4431960049938

I have an iPad and a brand name DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of brand name is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the brand name falls short in those areas. The brand name works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.br /br /Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new brand name is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the brand name 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new brand name, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.br /br /One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation brand names and the DX is the speed.

The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your brand name and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the brand name as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their brand name in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the brand name. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the brand name Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more",4.0
42,Retail Brand Brand Name Lighted Leather Cover Brand Name Keyboard,"['electronics', 'ereaders', 'accessories', '']",1.0,4.0,1,1.0,"High Quality Case For Your brand nameI purchased this brand name case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the brand name. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the brand name perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the brand name itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the brand name. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the brand name itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this brand name case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Target!",4.0
43,Retail Brand Brand Name Lighted Leather Cover Retail Brand Brand Name Lighted Leather Cover,"['electronics', 'ereaders', 'accessories', '']",1.0,3.0,1,0.0,"A Step Down In QualityI owned a brand name Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new brand name. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The brand name battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my brand name Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more",3.0

As an Target app member, I was able to buy the XYZ brand TV Stick for 19 during a two day sale. I figured, for that price, I might as well test it out!Set up was easy and straight forward. I find that the interface is quick and easy to use. The interface and streaming on the Stick is much faster than the Target app built into my HDTV. This fact alone made this a great purchase. Here are some more thoughts I have on the XYZ brand TV Stick so far: PROS:- Quick, easy to use, polished interface- Wireless streaming works really well- Target Instant video loads, fast forwards, and rewinds really fast- A dedicated app Menu allows app members to easily see what free content is available- Unlike Chromecast, the XYZ brand TV Stick includes a remote- Can stream your own videos by first uploading them to your cloud disk- Can play quite a few casual games- Awesome, irresistible price for Target app users. I got it for 19 during the two day sale.- Better specs than Chromecast and Roku Stick- Ultraportable. I plan to use XYZ brand TV Stick when I travel for work and to visit family- Stream local videos and other content using the Plex app http://www.Target.com/Plex-Inc/dp/B004Y1WCDE/ (Thanks BikeRider!) CONS:- Included remote doesn't support voice search. That remote costs extra. Would be nice to have a second XYZ brand TV Stick model that includes the voice search remote, rather can requiring us to buy a second remote.- Probably won't be able to use universal remotes with this unless Logitech offers a compatible device.- Not as fast as XYZ brand TV, but since the Stick is so much cheaper, this is not really an issue.Read more",15.0

(as a present to my mother in law) My initial reviews were written after playing with them for like 20 minutes. I merged both reviews into one to really compare the two products. I'm still answering questions in the comments if you have any. And see the video that compares the two and gives a mini tour of the brand name system.My Background: I've had 4 android phones, I've had multiple e-readers and my latest 'touch' device is the Le Pan II Android tablet. I've worked on several iPads but never been compelled to spend the extra money for one myself. Wife has a first generation XYZ brand.The new brand name XYZ brand and XYZ brand HD are the second generation color brand name e-reader/media player/tablet devices. The original XYZ brand received a lot of well earned 4 star reviews. It was a great product but at the end of the day, it was a first generation product. It was no iPad slayer. The XYZ brand HD raises the bar and raises it quite a lot. Jeff Bezos said they set out to make the best tablet available period and -in some regards- they did that in spades. In other ways not so much. (more on this below in the closing thoughts)HARDWARE:BUILD QUALITY:- BOTH are top Notch. I didn't expect anything less from Target but they really are solid feeling.- XYZ brand HD lighter and while it is about the same thickness, the edges are rounded more like an iPad. sleeker look and more comfortable to hold.- XYZ brand GEN 2 is heavier and 'boxier' built to more fit existing covers I guess. It's heavier too.SIZING:The HD is just a bit taller but a decent bit wider than the XYZ brand. --- NOTE pay attention to accessories because THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE.Read more",20.0
