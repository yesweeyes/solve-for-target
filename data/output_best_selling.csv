Electronics Brand Product Name Tablet A 10 1 Tablet 8 Hd Display Wi Fi 32 Gb Includes Special Offers Magenta,1.0,5.0,12,1.0,"Not the perfect do-it-all device, but very close to being the perfect e-reading device!I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new brand name as a gift. I have an iPad and a brand name DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of brand name is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the brand name falls short in those areas. The brand name works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.br /br /Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new brand name is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the brand name 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new brand name, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.br /br /One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation brand names and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more",60.0,['electronics']

Xyz Brand Kids Edition Tablet 7 Display Wi Fi 16 Gb Green Kid Proof Case,1.0,3.6666666666666665,6,0.5,"I'm stunned by negative reviews here.I bought one of the first Macs in the 80s. I've had 'too many to count since then.' I am an early adopter, by nature. This has been true of Target's brand name product as well having owned the First Generation brand name, K2, K3 and now the K Touch. Love the reader. And I love this case as well. I hear all of these complaints that this leather case looks cheap or doesn't have a closure, or it's too slippery. PLEASE. I find it to be a PERFECT fit for the brand name Touch. The unit snaps in a la DoDo Case -- which is such a great product for iPad. Very similar design only on a much smaller scale, obviously. The leather is not an issue for me. I do NOT find it to be too slippery at all unless, perhaps, your hands are covered in oil This is a first class cover for a first class e-reader. And NO. I do not work for Target. I'm just a HUGE brand name fan.",22.0,['accessories']
Xyz Brand Tablet 7 Display Wi Fi 8 Gb Includes Special Offers Magenta,1.0,5.0,4,1.0,"Compare XYZ brand HD to the brand name XYZ brand GEN 2UPDATE: I bought both a XYZ brand HD and a Gen 2. (as a present to my mother in law) My initial reviews were written after playing with them for like 20 minutes. I merged both reviews into one to really compare the two products. I'm still answering questions in the comments if you have any. And see the video that compares the two and gives a mini tour of the brand name system.My Background: I've had 4 android phones, I've had multiple e-readers and my latest 'touch' device is the Le Pan II Android tablet. I've worked on several iPads but never been compelled to spend the extra money for one myself. Wife has a first generation XYZ brand.The new brand name XYZ brand and XYZ brand HD are the second generation color brand name e-reader/media player/tablet devices. The original XYZ brand received a lot of well earned 4 star reviews. It was a great product but at the end of the day, it was a first generation product. It was no iPad slayer. The XYZ brand HD raises the bar and raises it quite a lot. Jeff Bezos said they set out to make the best tablet available period and -in some regards- they did that in spades. In other ways not so much. (more on this below in the closing thoughts)HARDWARE:BUILD QUALITY:- BOTH are top Notch. I didn't expect anything less from Target but they really are solid feeling.- XYZ brand HD lighter and while it is about the same thickness, the edges are rounded more like an iPad. sleeker look and more comfortable to hold.- XYZ brand GEN 2 is heavier and 'boxier' built to more fit existing covers I guess. It's heavier too.SIZING:The HD is just a bit taller but a decent bit wider than the XYZ brand. --- NOTE pay attention to accessories because THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE.Read more",20.0,['computers & tablets']
